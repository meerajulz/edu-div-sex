⏺ Looking at the FloatingMenu component, adding a volume
   button for video control would be moderately easy to
  implement. Let me analyze the requirements and
  complexity:

  📊 Volume Button Implementation - Difficulty: Medium

  Current Analysis:

  - FloatingMenu already has volume button assets
  (vol1.svg, vol2.svg) - they're commented out
  - The menu system supports dynamic button visibility
  (like we did with the map button)
  - Need to detect when videos are playing and
  communicate with video elements

  Implementation Strategy:

  Step 1: Detect Video Context
  - Check if user is on a page with video elements
  - Determine if video is currently playing
  - Track video elements across different activity
  scenes

  Step 2: Volume State Management
  - Global volume state (could use Context or
  localStorage)
  - Volume levels: muted, low, medium, high
  - Visual feedback for current volume level

  Step 3: Video Element Control
  - Find and control all video elements on the current
  page
  - Apply volume changes to active videos
  - Handle multiple videos (if any exist simultaneously)

  Technical Challenges:

  🟡 Medium Complexity Issues:
  1. Cross-Component Communication: FloatingMenu needs
  to communicate with video elements in scene components
  2. Video Detection: Need to identify when videos are
  present and playing
  3. State Persistence: Remember volume settings across
  page navigation
  4. Multiple Video Handling: Some scenes might have
  multiple videos

  Implementation Options:

  Option A: Context-Based (Recommended)
  // Create VolumeContext
  const VolumeContext = createContext({
    volume: 0.7,
    setVolume: () => {},
    isVideoPlaying: false
  });

  // FloatingMenu uses context to control volume
  // Scene components register their videos with context

  Option B: Direct DOM Manipulation
  // FloatingMenu finds video elements on page
  const videos = document.querySelectorAll('video');
  videos.forEach(video => video.volume = newVolume);

  Option C: Event-Based Communication
  // Use custom events to communicate between components
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('volumeChange', {
   detail: 0.8 }));

  Code Changes Needed:

  1. Uncomment volume button in FloatingMenu menuItems
  2. Add volume state management (Context or
  localStorage)
  3. Create volume control logic (mute/unmute, volume
  levels)
  4. Update video elements when volume changes
  5. Add conditional visibility (only show when videos
  present)

  Complexity Breakdown:

  - Volume Button UI: 🟢 Easy (already exists)
  - Volume State: 🟢 Easy (simple state management)
  - Video Detection: 🟡 Medium (need to scan for video
  elements)
  - Cross-Component Communication: 🟡 Medium (Context
  setup)
  - Volume Persistence: 🟢 Easy (localStorage)

  Estimated Time: ~30-45 minutes

  User Experience:

  - Volume button appears when videos are present on the
   page
  - Click to cycle through: 🔊 → 🔉 → 🔇 → 🔊
  - Volume setting persists across all videos and pages
  - Visual feedback shows current volume state

  Would you like me to implement this volume control
  feature? I'd recommend the Context-based approach for
  clean component communication.
