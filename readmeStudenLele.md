  4. How it works:
    - When creating a student and filling the
  evaluation form:
        - "Ninguno (1)" = No supervision needed =
  2 points
      - "Supervisión + Siempre (0,1)" = Sometimes
  needs help = 1 point
      - "Supervisión + A veces (0,0)" = Always
  needs help = 0 points
    - The system calculates percentage of
  independence and assigns:
        - Nivel 3 if ≥67% independent
      - Nivel 2 if 34-66% independent
      - Nivel 1 if <34% independent (needs most
  supervision)



  ⏺ Good! The API already returns s.* which includes
   the supervision_level field (line 27). The
  student detail page should now display the
  supervision level badge with colors:
  - Nivel 3 (green) - Independent
  - Nivel 2 (yellow) - Needs 50% supervision
  - Nivel 1 (red) - Needs 100% supervision

  The supervision level is now:
  1. ✅ Calculated during student creation (based
  on evaluation)
  2. ✅ Saved to the database
  3. ✅ Returned by the API
  4. ✅ Displayed on the student detail page with
  a color-coded badge




  5. Future improvements:
    - Add more detailed feedback for each
  evaluation
    - Allow custom evaluation criteria per
  student
    - Integrate with student progress tracking
  system
