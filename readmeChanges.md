  âœ… Progress Flow:

  1. When a game is completed â†’ The useProgressSaver hook calls saveProgress()
  2. Hook gets student data â†’ Fetches student ID from /api/students
  3. Sends to backend â†’ Makes POST request to /api/progress
  4. Backend saves to database â†’ Stores in student_progress table

  ðŸ“Š What gets saved:

  // Example from JuegoUno completion:
  await saveProgress('actividad-1', 'scene1', 'completed', 100, {
    game: 'JuegoUno',
    gender_completed: 'both', // or 'boy'/'girl'
    completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
  });

  Database record created:
  - student_id - Which student completed it
  - activity_slug - 'actividad-1'
  - scene_slug - 'scene1'
  - status - 'completed' or 'in_progress'
  - completion_percentage - 100%
  - game_data - JSON with game-specific details
  - started_at, completed_at, attempts - Timestamps and tracking

  TO DO

   ---
  ðŸŽ® Navigation Flow:

  - All scenes: Save progress â†’ Navigate to next scene
  - Final scenes: Save progress â†’ Return to /actividad-1 (main activity page)
  - Never go to dashboard - students stay in the activity flow

  ---
  ðŸ“ˆ Database Updates Made:

  - âœ… Added Actividad 2 (ID: 2) with 3 scenes
  - âœ… Added Actividad 3 (ID: 3) with 4 scenes
  - âœ… All 6 activities now exist: actividad-1 through actividad-6

  ---
  ðŸ”„ What Happens Now:

  1. Students can progress through all scenes in correct order
  2. Progress is saved at each step to database
  3. Activity protection prevents skipping ahead
  4. Dashboard shows admin/teacher view of student progress
  5. Students don't see their own progress dashboard (only teachers do)

  ---
  ðŸš€ TOMORROW'S TASKS:

  Apply the same exact pattern to:
  - Actividad-4 (scenes unknown - need to check)
  - Actividad-5 (scenes unknown - need to check)
  - Actividad-6 (scenes unknown - need to check)

  The pattern is now established - just repeat the same 3-step process (imports, hooks, progress
  saving) for each remaining scene! ðŸŽ¯
